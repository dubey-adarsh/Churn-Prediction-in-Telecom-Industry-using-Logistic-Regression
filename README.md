# Churn-Prediction-in-Telecom-Industry-using-Logistic-Regression

#### A Telecom company is losing Customers to its competitors. With the historical customer churn information that they have, they want a ML Model to predict, which of their present customers may churn. 

We have decided to create a `Logistic Regression` model to solve the problem. The Logistic Regression model will be expected to output a `Churn Probability` for every data under test. 

The input data is spread over 3 separate files - `churn_data.csv`, `cust_data.csv` and `internet_data.csv`. 

The Data includes the following: 

- `Personal Data (gender, children, whether senior citizen, dependents...)`
- `Services Related (Tenure with the provider, payment method, internet packs purchased, special offers...)`
- `Charges being incurred (Amount of recharge done per month...)`

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA process will comprise of Univariate and Multivariate Analysis alomg with abundant Visualisations.
